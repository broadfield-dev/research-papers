### **Abstract**

While modern AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning and tool-use capabilities, they fundamentally lack the capacity for long-term, autonomous learning. Most agents are stateless, resetting their knowledge after each session and failing to learn from their mistakes or successes. This paper introduces **iLearn**, a framework built upon a novel cognitive architecture designed to overcome this limitation. The core of our approach is a **Reflective Learning Loop** that processes interaction experiences into durable, operational knowledge. This architecture is centered on a **Dual-Component Knowledge Base**, which distinguishes between ephemeral, episodic `Memories` (records of what happened) and evolving, procedural `Rules` (guidelines for how to act). After each interaction, the agent initiates a post-hoc analysis, using a powerful LLM to curate insights from its performance and synthesize them into structured, actionable updates for its Rule set. We detail the methodology of this learning mechanism, provide a computer science deep-dive into its algorithmic implementation, and present its unique "Knowledge Canister" system that uses steganography to encapsulate the agent's entire learned state within a single image file for unparalleled portability.

### **1. Introduction**

The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of sophisticated agents capable of interacting with external tools and executing multi-step plans (Yao et al., 2022). However, the predominant paradigm for these agents remains one of "programmed intelligence." They operate based on a fixed system prompt and in-context examples, but they do not fundamentally change as a result of their experiences. This inherent "amnesia" is a critical bottleneck, preventing agents from achieving genuine adaptation, personalization, and long-term improvement. They can act, but they cannot truly learn.

The central challenge is not merely the absence of long-term memory, but the lack of a robust mechanism to process raw experience into operational wisdom. To address this, we propose a new model for agent design inspired by cognitive principles: an agent that learns by reflecting on its past.

This paper presents **iLearn**, a framework that implements this model through a novel cognitive architecture. iLearn's design is predicated on two core innovations:

1.  **A Dual-Component Memory System:** We move beyond a monolithic memory store by structuring the agent's knowledge base into two distinct types, analogous to human memory systems.
    *   **Episodic Memory (`Memories`):** A chronological log of specific past interactions—the "what" and "when" of the agent's experience.
    *   **Procedural & Semantic Memory (`Rules`):** A dynamic set of guiding principles, heuristics, and learned facts that govern the agent's behavior—the "how" and "why."

2.  **A Reflective Learning Loop:** This is the cognitive engine that drives adaptation. It is a post-interaction process that systematically transforms the raw data of episodic `Memories` into refined, durable `Rules`. This loop enables the agent to autonomously correct its errors, internalize new skills, and evolve its core identity over time.

Our contributions are as follows:
*   We define a cognitive architecture for self-improving agents based on a dual-component memory and a reflective learning loop.
*   We present a methodology for converting interaction experiences into persistent, operational knowledge using a structured, XML-based update protocol that ensures reliability.
*   We detail the specific algorithms and data structures used to implement this cognitive architecture, including vector-based semantic retrieval and a state-machine approach to learning.
*   We introduce a novel mechanism for knowledge base portability, the "Knowledge Canister," which uses steganography to embed an agent's entire learned state into a PNG image.

This work marks a step away from static, prompt-engineered agents toward dynamic, learning systems that improve with every interaction.

### **2. The Cognitive Architecture of iLearn**

The iLearn system is architected to support and execute the learning process. Its novelty lies in the structure of its knowledge base and the processes that act upon it.

**2.1. The Dual-Component Knowledge Base**
The agent's "mind" is its knowledge base, managed by the `memory_logic.py` module. It is composed of two distinct but interconnected components, both indexed for efficient semantic retrieval.

**2.1.1. Episodic Traces (`Memories`)**
This component serves as the agent's autobiographical memory. Each interaction is captured as a JSON object containing the user's input, the agent's full response, a timestamp, and a set of LLM-generated metrics (e.g., a `takeaway` summary and a `response_success_score`). These memories are immutable records of experience, providing the raw material for the learning process.

**2.1.2. Evolving Procedural Knowledge (`Rules`)**
This component represents the agent's learned wisdom and behavioral policies. It is a dynamic set of textual directives that are retrieved at the beginning of each interaction to guide the agent's planning and response. Each rule is structured with a `[TYPE|SCORE]` prefix to denote its category and confidence level.

| Rule Type              | Cognitive Analogue        | Example                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CORE_RULE**          | Self-Concept / Identity   | `[CORE_RULE\|1.0] I am Node, an AI that learns from user feedback.`      |
| **RESPONSE_PRINCIPLE** | Social Norms / Style      | `[RESPONSE_PRINCIPLE\|0.9] Always verify URLs before presenting them.` |
| **BEHAVIORAL_ADJUSTMENT**| Corrective Learning       | `[BEHAVIORAL_ADJUSTMENT\|0.8] Avoid verbose answers unless requested.`|
| **GENERAL_LEARNING**   | Semantic Fact / Preference| `[GENERAL_LEARNING\|0.9] The user is a developer interested in Gradio.` |

This separation is crucial: `Memories` are the data of experience, while `Rules` are the abstracted, operational knowledge derived from that experience.

### **3. The Reflective Learning Loop: From Experience to Wisdom**

The process of learning in iLearn is not an implicit side effect but an explicit, structured procedure. The loop consists of four distinct phases that occur for every significant interaction.

**Phase 1: Interaction and Experience Capture**
The agent engages with the user, using its tools and existing `Rules` to generate a response. This entire interaction—the query, the tool use, the final response—is encapsulated and prepared for storage. This phase concludes with the creation of a raw, unprocessed episodic trace.

**Phase 2: Post-Hoc Analysis and Metric Generation**
Immediately following the interaction, a background task initiates the reflection process. A fast LLM call analyzes the just-completed conversation to generate a concise summary (`takeaway`) and quantitative scores for success and confidence. This self-assessment is added to the episodic trace, which is then formally committed to the `Memories` store.

**Phase 3: Insight Curation and Rule Synthesis**
This is the core of the cognitive transformation. A powerful "curator" LLM is invoked with a highly structured prompt (`INSIGHT_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT`). The curator is tasked with acting as a knowledge engineer for the agent itself. Its sole function is to output a set of operations in a strict XML format. This protocol avoids the pitfalls of free-form self-correction, which can be unreliable. Each `<operation>` in the XML specifies an `action` (`add` or `update`), a new `insight` (the full text of the rule), and, for updates, the exact `old_insight_to_replace`.

**Phase 4: Knowledge Integration and Assimilation**
The orchestrator parses the generated XML and executes the operations on the `Rules` database. New rules are added, and old ones are replaced. The vector index is updated to include the new or modified rules. At the end of this phase, the learning is complete and the new knowledge is immediately available to influence future behavior.

### **4. Computer Science Implementation**

The conceptual architecture is realized through a specific set of algorithms, data structures, and implementation choices designed for robustness and efficiency.

**4.1. The Knowledge Base: Vector Search and Retrieval**
The agent's memory retrieval relies on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern.

*   **Data Structures:** In-memory, the `Memories` and `Rules` are stored as Python lists (`_memory_items_list`, `_rules_items_list`).
*   **Vectorization:** The `sentence-transformers` library, specifically the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, is used to convert the textual content of each Rule and Memory into a 384-dimensional floating-point vector (embedding). This model is chosen for its balance of speed and performance on semantic similarity tasks.
*   **Indexing and Search:** The `faiss` library provides the vector search functionality. We utilize the `IndexFlatL2` index type, which performs an exhaustive, brute-force search using the L2 (Euclidean) distance metric. For each query, the process is as follows:
    1.  The query string is encoded into a 384-dimension vector using the same `SentenceTransformer` model.
    2.  The `faiss` index's `search()` method is called with the query vector and the desired number of results, `k`.
    3.  This method returns the distances and indices of the `k`-nearest neighbors in the index.
    4.  These indices are used to look up the corresponding text items from the in-memory Python lists.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** When a new Rule or Memory is added, its vector is computed and added to the live `faiss` index using the `add()` method. When a Rule is removed, the entire index for Rules is rebuilt from the updated list to ensure consistency, a feasible operation for the expected scale of the Rule set.

**4.2. The Learning Loop: A State-Driven Procedure**
The learning loop is implemented as a deterministic procedure (`perform_post_interaction_learning` in `app.py`) that leverages LLMs within a strict, predictable workflow.

*   **Metrics Generation:** The system prompts an LLM with a template (`METRIC_GENERATION_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) that explicitly requests a JSON object as output. To handle cases where the LLM adds conversational text, the response is parsed using a regular expression (`re.search(r"\{.*?\}", ...)`), which reliably extracts the first valid JSON object from the string.
*   **Insight Synthesis and Parsing:** This is the most critical step for reliable learning.
    *   **Structured Prompting:** The `INSIGHT_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` is engineered to constrain the LLM's output to a single, valid XML structure. XML was chosen over JSON primarily for its native handling of multi-line strings within tags, which is ideal for rule text that may span several lines.
    *   **Reliable Parsing:** Instead of text manipulation, the system uses Python's standard `xml.etree.ElementTree` library to parse the LLM's output string. This parser is strict and will raise a `ParseError` if the XML is malformed, preventing corrupted data from entering the system. The code then deterministically iterates through the parsed tree, finding all `<operation>` elements and extracting their `<action>`, `<insight>`, and `<old_insight_to_replace>` children. This robust parsing pipeline is key to the stability of the learning loop.

**4.3. Knowledge Portability: Applied Cryptography and Steganography**
The "Knowledge Canister" feature is a practical application of data serialization, encryption, and steganography.

*   **Algorithm:** The core technique is Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography, where the least significant bit of each color channel value in a pixel is replaced with a bit from the data payload.
*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Serialization:** The entire KB (`Rules` and `Memories`) is serialized into a single key-value formatted string using `convert_kb_to_kv_string`.
    2.  **Encryption (Optional):** If a password is provided, the serialized byte stream is encrypted using the `cryptography` library with the AES-GCM authenticated encryption cipher. A key is derived from the password using `PBKDF2HMAC` with a random salt, ensuring that the same password produces different keys for different canisters.
    3.  **Data Framing:** The final byte payload (encrypted or plaintext) is prepended with a 4-byte header (`struct.pack('>I', len(data))`) that encodes the total length of the payload.
    4.  **Embedding:** The carrier image is converted to a flattened NumPy array of pixel values. The framed data is converted into a stream of bits. The code then iterates through this bit stream, overwriting the LSB of each sequential pixel value (`(pixel_value & 0xFE) | data_bit`).
    5.  **Extraction:** The reverse process reads the LSBs from the start of the image to reconstruct the 4-byte length header, determines the payload size, and then reads that many subsequent bits to reconstruct the full data payload.

### **5. Knowledge Persistence and Portability**

A learning system is only as effective as its ability to retain knowledge. iLearn provides robust mechanisms for both persistence and portability.

*   **Persistence Backends:** The system is backend-agnostic, supporting volatile RAM, persistent local SQLite, or a cloud-based Hugging Face Datasets repository.
*   **The Knowledge Canister:** The steganographic embedding of the entire knowledge base into a single PNG image provides a "brain in a file." This allows for perfect backups, effortless migration of the agent's learned state, and the ability to fork and version the agent's evolution by simply saving and sharing an image file.

---

### **6. Empirical Demonstration of Learning**

The `node_mem_1.json` and `node_rules_1.txt` files provide a clear, empirical trace of the learning process. An early interaction shows the agent providing a web search result with broken links. The user provides corrective feedback.

*   **Experience (Phase 1 & 2):** An episodic `Memory` is created documenting the failed interaction and the user's negative feedback. The `response_success_score` would be low.
*   **Reflection (Phase 3):** The curator LLM, seeing this failure, generates an XML operation to update an existing rule.
    *   **Old Rule:** `[RESPONSE_PRINCIPLE|0.8] I will provide clickable links.`
    *   **New Rule:** `[RESPONSE_PRINCIPLE|1.0] I must verify links with my tools before providing them to ensure they are accurate and working.`
*   **Assimilation (Phase 4):** The old rule is replaced with the new, more precise one.

In a subsequent, similar task, the agent now has an explicit, high-priority directive to verify links, leading to a more successful outcome.

### **7. Discussion and Future Work**

The iLearn framework demonstrates that it is possible to build AI agents that move beyond static programming to a state of continuous, autonomous learning. The core architectural decision to separate episodic experience from procedural knowledge, and to link them with an explicit reflective loop, provides a robust and auditable model for self-improvement.

**Limitations:** The quality of learning is fundamentally constrained by the reasoning capability of the curator LLM. Furthermore, while the system can consolidate rules, it currently lacks an explicit mechanism for resolving logical conflicts between two high-scoring but contradictory rules.

**Future Work:** Research will focus on enhancing the cognitive architecture. This includes developing a **rule validation subsystem** to test new insights before integration, evolving the `GENERAL_LEARNING` rules into a more structured **knowledge graph** to enable deeper reasoning, and conducting long-term experiments to study the emergence of complex behaviors and the potential for knowledge decay or "catastrophic forgetting."

### **8. Conclusion**

We have presented iLearn, a novel cognitive architecture for building self-improving AI agents. By integrating a dual-component memory system with a reflective learning loop, and by grounding this system in a robust technical implementation, iLearn demonstrates a practical methodology for an agent to learn from its experience, refine its behavior, and evolve its knowledge over time. This approach represents a significant step toward creating more intelligent, adaptive, and genuinely useful AI systems.
